# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Segmentation at NexaSat

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and segmenting customers based on their Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) at NexaSat. CLV is a crucial metric that helps businesses understand the total value a customer brings over the entire duration of their relationship with the company. By segmenting customers based on CLV, NexaSat aims to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and maximize overall profitability.

## Objectives

- Calculate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for each customer.
- Segment customers based on their CLV.
- Analyze the characteristics of each segment.
- Develop targeted marketing strategies for different customer segments.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes the following data sources:
- **Customer Data**: Contains customer demographics and behavioral information.
- **Transaction Data**: Contains historical purchase data, including transaction dates, amounts, and product details.
- **Engagement Data**: Contains information on customer interactions with the company, such as website visits, email opens, and customer support interactions.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Gather data from various sources and consolidate it into a single dataset.
- Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Transform the data to ensure consistency and compatibility for analysis.

### 2. Calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Define the formula for CLV considering factors such as purchase frequency, average order value, and customer lifespan.
- Calculate the CLV for each customer using historical transaction data.

### 3. Segmentation
- Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) to segment customers based on their CLV.
- Determine the optimal number of segments using metrics such as the elbow method or silhouette score.

### 4. Segment Analysis
- Analyze the characteristics of each segment, including demographics, purchasing behavior, and engagement levels.
- Identify key differentiators and patterns within each segment.

### 5. Strategy Development
- Develop targeted marketing strategies for each segment to enhance customer engagement and retention.
- Propose personalized offers, loyalty programs, and communication plans tailored to the needs of each segment.

## Tools and Technologies

- **PostgreSQL**: For data processing, analysis, and modeling.


## Results and Insights

- Detailed CLV calculations for each customer.
- Identification of distinct customer segments based on CLV.
- Comprehensive analysis of segment characteristics and behaviors.
- Actionable insights for developing targeted marketing strategies.

## Future Work

- Incorporate real-time data to continuously update CLV calculations and segmentations.
- Explore advanced machine learning models for more accurate CLV predictions.
- Implement and monitor the effectiveness of targeted marketing strategies.

## Conclusion

This project provides a systematic approach to analyzing and segmenting customers based on their Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) at NexaSat. By understanding the value each customer brings and tailoring strategies accordingly, NexaSat can improve customer retention, enhance engagement, and drive long-term profitability.
